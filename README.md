# AirBnB_clone - The Console

![alt](img/hbnb.png)
---
## Description

This project is the first step towards building a first full web application: an AirBnB clone. This first step (back-end) consists of a custom command-line interface for data management, and the base classes for the storage of this data to be used for the development of the application.

## Files and Directories

* models directory will contain all classes used for the entire project. A class, called “model” in a OOP project is the representation of an object/instance.
* tests directory will contain all python unit tests.
* console.py file is the entry point of our command interpreter.
* models/base_model.py file is the base class of all our models. It contains common elements:
    * attributes: id, created_at and updated_at
    * methods: save() and to_json()
    * models/engine directory will contain all storage classes (using the same prototype). For the moment I will have only one: file_storage.py
